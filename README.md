# Brain_Tumor_Classification
This project develops a machine learning model (Convolutional Neural Network) for brain tumor disease classification using image data sets from Kaggle. 
This project involves data preprocessing and image augmentation to enrich the model's knowledge. 
The result is a model that can predict diabetes with an accuracy of around 87 percent, which can be useful for doctors in supporting brain tumor diagnosis decisions. 
The models that can be downloaded are h5 models and also tflite models that have been carried out aware quantization

Note:
You can download it and use the source code or the model if you want
